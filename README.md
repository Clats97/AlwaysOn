# AlwaysOn Mouse Jiggler

A simple, lightweight Python script that jiggles your mouse so your screen doesnt turn on, or your boss monitors your "activity" while working from home.

You need to install the pyautogui dependency by typing "pip install pyautogui" into command prompt. Then, either run the command line version or the graphical user interface version and follow the instructions.

It's that simple.
